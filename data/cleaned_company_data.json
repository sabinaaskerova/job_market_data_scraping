            "Presentation": "Fintecture reinvents payment by bank transfer to enable businesses to generate more revenue. Traditional payment methods have limitations (ceilings, processing times and costs) that restrict certain sales. By digitalizing bank transfers and enriching them with key sales features, Fintecture leverages technology to facilitate more efficient commercial transactions. To achieve this, Fintecture offers both its own payment infrastructure and essential services for commercial exchanges, such as clear and reliable payment status updates for merchants, perfect and automated reconciliation, refund management, fraud detection, and more. Fintecture’s products are adaptable to all sales channels (online, offline, in-store) and complex B2B purchasing processes. Fintecture now operates in several European countries, serving nearly a million payers. Many international merchants benefit from its services, including market leaders like Auchan, Decathlon, Leroy Merlin, Bricoman, Edenred, CMA CGM, Aramis Auto, Maison du Monde, and more. Launched in 2020, Fintecture completed a Series A funding round of €26 million in 2022, totaling €32 million raised, and was awarded Fintech of the Year by AGEFI in 2023.",
            "What they are looking for": "At Fintecture, we believe that payment is not just about transferring funds from account A to account B. It's more than just a financial flow; it's at the heart of a value chain that plays a decisive role in a company's growth and profitability. It is the culmination of a commercial agreement between buyer and seller, and is therefore central to the customer experience, team productivity, cash management, speed of service or delivery of supplies... Technology now removes certain constraints linked to traditional payment methods: it streamlines exchanges and thus unlocks sales that otherwise would not be completed or would generate significant costs (both financial and human). That is why we chose to leverage technology to digitalize bank transfers, equipping businesses with efficient payment tools to maximize their commercial performance and boost their revenue. To do this, we need the best talent - people who can grasp the fundamental challenges of today's booming payments industry! We are currently in a period of exponential growth, and our team has grown from 7 to over 70 talents, from a wide range of backgrounds in terms of experience, age and nationality. Joining our Fin'Team will place you at the forefront of the innovative payment sector. If you are looking for new perspectives, a stimulating and flexible work environment, and are ready to push boundaries... Then welcome aboard!",

This allows them to participate in projects for several of the Volkswagen Group´s brands. They boast state-of-the-art development and testing laboratories in Prague, Pilsen, Mladá Boleslav, and the latest in Brno. Some of their biggest projects include robotic parking or carsharing technology.",

They are expanding their teams with both junior candidates (and fresh graduates) and experienced professionals, not only from the automotive world. The candidates must have an interest in new technologies, team spirit, knowledge of a foreign language (AJ or NJ), and a desire to participate in creating the future of the automotive industry. They understand that everyone has a personal life. If needed, it is no problem to take time off that is not taken from vacation. Later in the month, the day off can be made up with overtime. Since they are in the automotive industry, they can offer their employees services that they do not get as individuals. For example, more advantageous operating leases or services on Skoda cars. They invest heavily in training and tailor courses to suit everyone´s needs for their job.",
            "It's good to know": "They test electronic systems in laboratories before they can go out into the world. In virtual reality, they can simulate complex situations, including traffic obstacles, and take driver behavior into account. This allows them to try out several scenarios to determine which one will better prepare the software under test for the real world. The sharing economy has been a trend in recent years, so they are working on systems that will make car sharing easier, even for older cars."

It allows farmers to measure and certify their carbon footprint each year, while valuing their reduced carbon emissions and/or increased soil carbon storage on the carbon markets. Agricultural and food companies use Soil Capital Carbon as a transition tool to engage their farmers in a certified low-carbon approach and build new value opportunities through the development of certified low-carbon value chains. Soil Capital Carbon is supported by mySoilCapital, a farmer and partner portal that collects, processes and delivers data so that farmers and partners can implement better regenerative and low carbon agriculture.

In France 20% of the students who graduate from elementary school (collège) can't read proficiently enough to keep up with the academic demands of the classroom. In the U.S, that number goes up to 30%. By providing individualised learning to students they want to drive that number down to 0. To reach this goal, they have brought together experts in pedagogy, teachers, designers and technologists who work hand in hand to build the best classroom tools for students and educators. Lalilo joined Renaissance Learning in 2021 to accelerate its development and reach more and more students throughout the world.",

Its innovative technology called \"Multi-local Advertising\" is based on machine learning, geolocation and programmatic, to enable retailers to be more visible online and thus compete with pure players (Amazon).

Based in France, ARMIS is working with French retailers from Food and Non-Food industries such as Intermarché, Monoprix, Auchan, Norauto, Joué-Club, Bricorama.

Now, Lydia Solutions is reaching a new milestone: after launching our new Lydia app in early April, 100% dedicated to friend-to-friend repayments and pots, we're unveiling our new app today: Sumeria. It's the start of a new era, in which we intend to create the banking experience that customers crave.",

            "Good to know": "The name Lydia comes from the kingdom of Lydia (part of present-day Turkey), where the first coins were minted in the 7th century BC. Coins made of electrum, a natural alloy of gold and silver found in abundance in the river Pactolus, brought wealth to the kingdom. The last and most famous king of Lydia was none other than Croesus. \"Pactole\" and \"Cresus\" are terms that have gone down in history and are commonly used to signify wealth. The choice of the name Lydia is therefore a symbolic nod to the most modern payment technology in the history of money. As for the name Sumeria, it comes from the Sumerian language, one of the oldest attested languages, dating back to at least 2900 BC. It was the language spoken in ancient Mesopotamia. Why the name Sumeria?\r\nFor our project to create a major European deposit bank, we chose an ambitious name: Sumeria.\r\nThe Sumerians invented writing to keep their accounts on clay. 55 centuries later, we're carrying on this legacy with a reliable, durable and practical application."

So we set out to reinvent insurance, making it truly customer-centric, as we believe it was always meant to be. We began by building the most transparent and useful insurance company: one that you can finally trust because its business model is designed for positive impact, and its product experience is intended to empower rather than mislead users. We developed the most intuitive, user-focused insurance experience you can imagine: sign-up in 2 minutes, a straightforward offer, customizable coverage, no hidden fees, no long-term commitment, and termination in just 3 clicks. In just 6 years, over 400,000 users have placed their trust in us. We quickly became a leader in the online home insurance market, leveraging technology to enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. By 2022, 25% of home insurance policies sold online in France were Luko policies, and nearly half of our new customers came through recommendations from friends and family. In February 2024, Luko joined Allianz Direct, the digital European subsidiary of the Allianz Group, to become the market leader in direct home insurance in France. This partnership solidifies Luko's position as the strongest neo-insurer. Together, with our shared vision and values, Luko and Allianz Direct continue our mission to disrupt the market by offering the best value for money, with even greater simplicity and transparency.",

            "Presentation": "Yogosha was founded in 2015 by entrepreneurs passionate about infosec with the same ambition: to contribute to a safer world, by bridging the gap between communities who strive for the same outcome: better security. Such communities exist out of organizations, ethical hackers, CISOs, developers, security teams, etc.\r\nThe vision has remained unchanged, but the company has grown a lot since its beginnings. Yogosha's headquarters are still in Paris, but with teams all over the world. In France, England, Dubai… Dozens of people strive every day to make the world a little safer. Nothing would be possible without them, so we make sure to take care of each other. This is a core value of Yogosha.\r\nAnd since we are talking about making things possible: Yogosha is backed by leading investors with invaluable confidence. We think of Yogosha as a VOC – a Vulnerability Operations Center.\r\nA hub to detect, manage and fix vulnerabilities.\r\nA platform to bring together all communities – CISOs, ethical hackers, dev and sec teams...\r\nA battleground to run multiple security operations – VDP, penetration testing and bug bounty.\r\nA command center to oversee all vulnerability management strategies.\r\nA more efficient security, that is Yogosha You don't change a winning team, but you can make it bigger. In 2022, Yogosha doubled its teams thanks to the €10M of raised funds at the beginning of the year. Today, we are a team of 40+ people. At Yogosha, we like to think that each individual, each employee has the freedom to be who they are. You are probably saying to yourself “Yes, like all startups!” Likely, but with us it is concrete: **“Come as you are”. ** It sounds a bit fast foody, but we couldn't find a better way to say that everyone is welcome. We all have a different background: the important thing is to want to work in cyber security, not to have worked in the industry before..  not the other way around. If you are in Paris, there will always be someone to chat with at the office – brand new premises in the heart of Paris. Some colleagues will be there every morning, others a few days a week or full remote. What about you?  Each month we organize events such as: Karaoke, virtual reality, theater, breakfast… We have activities for every taste. If you prefer informal meetings, there will always be a bunch of colleagues who will come with you for a drink or two – some more than others!",
            "What they are looking for": "Yogosha is looking for talented and open minded teammates in various fields (engineering, sales, marketing...). They need people who want to break cliches around the hacking world, and help make internet a safer place. Humor and trust are fundamental values at Yogosha. The company’s whole image is built on transparency : helping clients trust the hacking world by collaborating with the best security experts. Obviously, being attracted to technology and cybersecurity are important to work at Yogosha. But we’re mostly looking for hard-working and curious people, who aren’t afraid of challenges and responsibilities.",
            "Good to know": "To join Yogosha, you will need to : Understand that hackers aren’t only criminals selling your credit card on the darknet Be ready for offbeat humor Buy breakfast whenever you leave your computer open without locking it 😀"

In fact, their Co-founder Dharmesh Shah codified their culture, creating HubSpot’s Culture Code, a 120+ slide deck detailing their values, operating systems, and much more. Results matter more than the hours we work. HubSpot wants its employees to have the flexibility to choose how they do their best work. That’s why they’re building a hybrid company where employees can choose @home, @office, or @flex. HubSpot wants to create a company that future generations can be proud of.

Working at Hollis & Bean also means supporting other team members and treating suppliers with respect. The agency prides itself on the fact that many of its partners have been working with it since the very beginning: its supplier retention is as good as its client retention!",

            "Presentation": "Founded in 2017, reciTAL is one of the first international teams to master and exploit large pre-trained language models. As early as 2017, we used Transformers-based language models to provide document processing tools. Thanks to their pre-training on large volumes of data, these models have an innate language understanding faculty that facilitates document processing tasks. In addition to “seeing” the document, the machine can also read it and understand the meaning of words and sentences. These technologies make it possible to drastically reduce the volume of data needed to learn the task. Whether extractive or generative, these models have brought IDP (Intelligent Document Processing) into a new era. reciTAL now offers a complete LAD / RAD solution to exploit the power of large language models, On Premises or in SaaS. The reciTAL team was built around two principles: excellence and diversity. reciTAL has an international team (+10 languages ​​spoken) of very high level (5 doctors and engineers from major schools). Led by a cutting-edge research team (scientific committee with the University of Berkeley), reciTAL counts several major French banks and insurers among its clients, representing more than 80,000 active users. reciTAL was a member of the G20 des Entrepreneurs 2017, won the AI ​​Awards and the Finance Innovation favorite in 2019 and received the DeepTech label from the BPI in 2021. reciTAL raised €3.5M with Breega in September 2020 to accelerate its development.",

            "Presentation": "In 2017, Luc de Brabandere, Martin Saive and Thomas Doutrepont, the three co-founders of Cartoonbase, had a eureka moment. They realised that there was an amazingly simple way for organisations to clarify and communicate on increasingly complex topics. It had existed for millennia, yet was largely underused: illustration. So they built a solution that would allow organisations large and small to leverage the power of illustrations and visual thinking: simplifying complex topics; ensuring inclusivity of messages; sharing a wide variety of emotions; producing content that can easily be adapted for different audiences, channels and usages; and much more. This solution is cartoonbase. Cartoonbase is an atypical place where illustrators, creative writers, graphic designers and video artists collaborate with business consultants, strategists, philosophers and even historians to create smart and educational visual aids for organisations all around the world. Today, more than 30 cartoonbasers in three different locations (Brussels, Lausanne and Paris) join forces to offer videos, branding services, infographics, social media campaigns, creative workshops and live drawing services to more than 200 clients.",

Rule number 1 is to do whatever possible to help collaborators succeed. \n \n Professionalism. Having a lot of fun and experiencing every day the awe of creation goes hand in hand with the highest standards of quality and service. \n \n Humour. Laughing once in a while diminishes stress, increases the bond with our peers, encourages creativity and doesn’t harm productivity. Cartoonbasers are all quite funny chaps… in their very own way. \n",

How do they do this? By transforming their paper scores into digital, interactive and collaborative sheet music. No more heavy binders, no more stress of turning pages, no more photocopying. Newzik is a bit like Google Docs for sheet music: a software ecosystem that allows musicians to keep all of their scores in a digital library accessible at any time, to work on them with dedicated tools, and to share them in real time with other users. Newzik's strengths are its numerous features, but also its ease of use and customer support, which have enabled it to reach 150,000 downloads on the App Store since its launch, and in just a few years it has established itself as the reference tool for orchestras and opera houses, which the company accompanies with training offers. Driven by its initial success with music professionals, Newzik then developed tools for sheet music publishers in order to co-create with them a smooth and secure distribution channel for all players in the chain. After raising nearly 3 million euros, Newzik is now focusing all its efforts on meeting the pressing needs of music education: the start-up seeks to actively support the next generation of musicians by improving interaction between teachers and their students, both in the classroom and remotely. Today, the company is therefore looking to expand internationally to give access to its tools to as many people as possible.",

Thus, the assembled team started to operate in a new yellow and black \"jersey\" but with the same vision. The company's corporate culture has since taken a big step forward. Instead of being a punk startup, the international team has shifted to more efficient processes, allowing it to help even more clients and users. Yet they have retained the startup energy and most importantly - the appetite to change the job market. Flexible working hours and home-office are a given. The office is used to meet with colleagues, clients or candidates, but work can be done from anywhere. The team has many internal rituals to keep them informed, educated and pulling together. The company is based in Prague's Vinohrady district, a short walk from Náměstí Míru, in a location full of popular cafes, restaurants and bistros. There is also a large terrace where colleagues regularly meet for meetings and celebrations of success.

As a committed company since 2012, originator of 'Zero Waste' shelves, Smartway has created the first Food Waste Management System platform to optimise the end-of-life pathway for food products.

In the Czech Republic, the company has two branches – BNP Paribas Cardif Pojišťovna (insurance company) and BNP Paribas Cardif Services. The former branch cooperates primarily with banks that offer their products to the customers. Their chief discipline is the payment protection insurance, and they were one of the pioneers of this type of insurance in the Czech Republic. The latter company branch is the knowledge center for the entire Central Europe. It comprises of IT, Marketing, HR, Finance, and several other departments. Its corporate culture is considerably more free-spirited, but everybody still makes up a crack team. The Services was founded in 2017 that has been growing like weeds ever since. Many natives and foreigners work here daily on international projects. All the apps are tailor-made by the programmers in Services for their insurance companies.",

It was founded three years ago with a simple mission: to turn the world into a giant game board.\r\nThe first product, Neopolis, is a mobile game where you can buy real-world buildings and landmarks. Neopolis invites players to (re)discover their city, explore the world, collaborate and trade with other inhabitants and build their real estate empire in the Neoverse. Taking their enthusiasm further, they’re building a more persistent world where everyone can have fun and socialize in a casual game, but also own plots of land with real-world inputs and participate in the Governance of the community. \r\nThe video game market is very fast moving and very competitive, so you have to be exceptionally creative and efficient to have a chance to develop the next hit. This requires a good culture above all. Revolt Games was built on a foundation of working methods that gave them the ability to create quickly and freely: cutting-edge technologies, individual freedom and ownership for employees, strong focus on the community, fast iterations with data validation, transparency. 3M players in Europe and 250k active users Neopolis shows retention and engagement metrics among the top 0.1% in the mobile gaming industry. Traction in Web3: The first collection of 10,000 lands sold out in seven minutes. Raised €2.5 million with investors and entrepreneurs from the gaming, web3, and social media industries.",
